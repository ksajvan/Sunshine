Udacity course Weather data application.
App shows current weather for selected location as well as weather for following week. Final implementation (master) uses services
to fetch data from API. In order to run the application, user has to register on http://openweathermap.org/api and acquire API_KEY which
then should be inserted in app/build.gradle file instead of 'YOUR_API_KEY' string.
Screen capture images of the phone app can be founded at Wiki page of the github. Application also suports tablets in which case it
will show weather list on the left side of the screen, while fragment will show detail info on the right side.
